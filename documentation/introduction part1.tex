\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Introduction}

Elderly individuals who live alone face significant health and safety challenges, including medical emergencies, falls, and feelings of isolation. Due to the lack of immediate assistance, these incidents can lead to delayed medical attention and complications. Furthermore, isolation can negatively affect their mental and emotional health. The absence of regular check-ins and health tracking increases the risk of undetected health deterioration.

The project aims to help develop a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to enhance the safety, health monitoring, and social well-being of elderly individuals living alone. Through tracking real-time health (using APIs like Google Fit), the app will ensure caregivers/family members can monitor their health status from a distance .

The ElderCare Connect will function across multiple devices (desktops, smartphones, and tablets) with native app-like experiences, providing real-time health monitoring, emergency alerts, and social engagement features.  Push notifications will ensure immediate attention during emergencies. Messaging features will help elderly connected with family, friends, and caregivers, mitigating loneliness and providing emotional support with PWA advantages. Data security and privacy are top priorities.

\subsection{Objectives}

The main aim of this project is to facilitate all-encompassing support for elderly living alone by introducing an accessible Progressive Web Application (PWA) integrating health monitoring, emergency response and social engagement services.
The app will use wearable devices to provide caregivers and family members with real-time data on the health status of a user, while also adopting a third-party API such as Google Fit.
For medical emergencies, the app will alert caregivers or emergency services immediately so that they can provide immediate help.
It will also include a social interaction component to eradicate loneliness by allowing users the ability to communicate with family and friends as well.
While achieving data security and privacy, the project also targets seamless user experience as we add offline capability while push notifications will be a top priority, with robust authentication and encryption methods in place to safeguard sensitive user information.

\subsection{Benefits of this Research}

The benefits of this research extend beyond immediate health monitoring and emergency response; it significantly enhances the overall well-being of elderly individuals living alone. By providing real-time tracking of vital signs through wearable technology, the project could reduce hospitalizations and prevent severe medical conditions from escalating. In addition to that, by medication reminders elderly users will not forget their daily dose of medicines.
The integration of emergency alert systems ensures rapid intervention during critical situations, potentially lowering mortality rates and long-term complications. Social engagement features address the mental health challenges associated with loneliness and social isolation, which are common among the elderly, thus improving their emotional resilience and quality of life.
The research promotes the development of secure and scalable digital health solutions, ensuring that sensitive health data is protected through robust security measures. It paves the way for future innovations in elderly care technology, setting a precedent for more advanced applications that can be used in home-based and institutional care environments. From the caregivers and family’s perspective, this research provides peace of mind, offering a reliable, real-time method of staying connected with their loved ones' health and safety.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Background}

In recent decades, smartphones have significantly changed the way we live. In terms of the health sector, elderly individuals now have greater access to health information and can enhance the convenience of managing their medical care through mobile applications. Several studies have shown the positive impact of mobile health interventions in managing lifestyle factors such as improving diet, quitting smoking, and increasing physical activity, as well as controlling chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension. This change has also influenced the relationship between patients and their general practitioners.

Recent research has shown that patients see mobile health apps as valuable tools for self-monitoring and self-managing their own health. However, they also acknowledge certain limitations, such as issues with battery life and concerns regarding the legal aspects of electronic prescribing.

Moreover, there has been increasing concern regarding the rising number of elderly individuals, particularly those living alone due to the population ageing across the globe. This demographic group faces great challenges, including high health risks, social disconnectedness, and slow responses in case of emergencies that may endanger their lives. Considering that such a severe future scenario would likely occur much faster than a call for help or even faster than some normal medical conditions, there is a need for solutions that can protect the elderly, particularly those without nearby family members, from possible future threats.

\subsubsection{Threats to the Lives of Elderly Living Alone}

Some common venture medical emergencies include the sudden health collapse experienced by many elderly people with chronic diseases such as heart conditions, diabetes, or even mobility problems. Most times, these medical emergencies occur when the elderly are alone, and this results in treatment being delayed which ultimately leads to worse outcomes.

Falls are inherent dangers for the elderly and statistical data among this age group shows that these occurrences are frequent in old age. When an elderly individual does not receive services, or assistance immediately after suffering a fall, it can lead to serious consequences such as bone fractures or head trauma and in some cases may end with being bedridden for long periods of time.
Several studies have already shown the relationship between social isolation and the moral health of elderly people, leading either to depression or dementia. In addition to that, such self-imposing isolation because of scarcity of social contact may also prevent a person from leading a healthy life or postpone a visit to a medical doctor when required.

\section{Literature Review and Scope}
\subsection{Literature Review}

Existing technological solutions for the elderly have a tendency to address very distinct elements of support while failing to offer a completely holistic and integrated experience. LifeFone, a medical monitoring device with emergency alerts, enables swift help in case of medical emergencies, such as falls or any sort of sudden illness.  MediSafe provides reminders for medicines that can assist the individuals in managing treatment compliance.  Aloe Care offers features such as activity detection and caregiver engagement tools for greater awareness, but it offers minimal services in health status and safety monitoring.

The literature shows that current solutions have been created in separate entities, and therefore there's an absence of a method which will provide seamless connectivity and coordination among these solutions. Health monitoring functionalities are frequently underdeveloped on mobile apps; therefore users don’t have a complete picture of their wellbeing.  Communication tools might also be missing and are necessary for the prevention of senior isolation, depression and an active engagement inside a supportive community.   These current products often lack user friendly interfaces, which are essential for people who may have difficulty with computers and may not be familiar with it.

\subsection{Scope}

The ElderlyCare Connect project's scope involves the building of a PWA which provides seniors living independently complete features for health, and connectivity, which ensures their safety and social engagement. Wearable sensor applications are to be used for continuous monitoring of vital parameters like the heart rate, blood pressure and activity level, thus permitting quick detection of issues needing quick actions. As a support measure, there's an immediate alert feature which instantly notifies the caregivers as well as the emergency teams, helping guarantee that support will be sent rapidly during critical times. Messaging features and location tracking also will be included. The project prioritizes user-friendly design for seniors.

\section{Problem Statement}
Elderly individuals living alone face a confluence of interconnected problems that significantly compromise their well-being. While there are existing systems to assist in distinct areas such as emergency help and medications compliance, these solutions usually fail to give a complete approach that addresses diverse and interconnected requirements of seniors.

There is an issue because often have delayed medical responses can be a vital issue. Medical emergencies that involves falls or stroke can prove detrimental when medical response is slow, which leads to severe consequences such as disability or, worse, loss. Existing emergency systems need improvements on how they can be improved. Seniors can't always be certain about their situations, since sudden medical issues, such as paralysis or serious mental condition, can render them incapable of activating those alerts.

There is one more component that are causing a great risk to elderly individuals, are the isolation and loneliness. This problem has wide implications for physical and mental well-being.
This project is committed to developing an application PWA, to mitigate the issues that current systems have, thus, our commitment to help the seniors is in high regard.

\section{Proposed Solution}
The proposed solution, ElderCare Connect, is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to serve as a comprehensive, integrated platform for elderly individuals living alone. We will leverage a range of technologies, in order to address the diverse requirements of these individuals.

First, we will have an integration with wearable devices for real-time tracking of vital signs. Through real-time health monitoring systems which utilizes wearable devices, such as fitness bands/smartwatches will enable us to monitor critical indications such as their heart rate, blood pressure and their activities over the time with high precision. The data will immediately transmit using the PWA, that way caregivers/family may observe it and monitor their health on a continuous basis.

For any critical situations that will be triggered by those seniors, will also give the capability to those care takers which enable help as soon as possible. A user-friendly design interface can definitely make a huge difference in making technology more accessible for elders. By incorporating larger text, basic navigation and visual icons which can be seen as easier compared to traditional apps, ElderCare Connect’s intention is to be naturally integrated inside their daily routine. We will also be incorporating a wide integration of social features that will include features in messaging, video conference, and forums and even social activity.
