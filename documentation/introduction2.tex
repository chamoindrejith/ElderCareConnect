    \item Implement location tracking capabilities to assist family members in locating seniors during emergencies
    \item Provide medication adherence support through automated reminder notifications
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Health Monitoring:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Integrate with biometric monitoring devices to track vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, and physical activity levels
    \item Establish data visibility for designated family members to facilitate remote health monitoring
    \item Deliver personalized health recommendations based on collected biometric data
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Social Connectivity:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Facilitate seamless communication with family and friends through messaging and media sharing capabilities
    \item Provide access to community engagement opportunities through event and group discovery features
    \item Enable digital storytelling and memory sharing to strengthen familial connections
\end{itemize}

Additionally, the application will prioritize:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accessibility through user-friendly interface design featuring large text and simplified navigation
    \item Offline functionality to ensure critical features remain available during internet connectivity interruptions
