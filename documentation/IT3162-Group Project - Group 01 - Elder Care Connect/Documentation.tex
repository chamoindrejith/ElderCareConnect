\chapter*{Abstract}
ElderCare Connect is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to enhance the safety, health monitoring, and social well-being of elderly individuals living alone. The elderly population faces significant challenges including medical emergencies, falls, and social isolation, which can lead to delayed treatment and deteriorating mental health. This application addresses these concerns by providing real-time health monitoring through integration with APIs like Google Fit, emergency response features with instantaneous alerts to caregivers or emergency services, and social engagement tools to combat isolation. Leveraging PWA technology, ElderCare Connect delivers native app-like experiences across multiple devices while maintaining offline functionality and requiring no app store installation.The application prioritizes user-friendly interface design with accessibility features for elderly users, robust security measures to protect sensitive health data, and scalable architecture to support growing user needs. By empowering elderly users to maintain independence while offering peace of mind to family members and caregivers, ElderCare Connect aims to improve quality of life, reduce hospitalization rates, and enhance the emotional resilience of elderly individuals living alone, ultimately promoting dignified and safe aging at home.
