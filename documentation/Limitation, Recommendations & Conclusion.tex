\chapter{Limitations, Recommendations, and Conclusion}

\section{Limitations}
While the proposed Progressive Web Application (PWA) offers significant advantages for elderly individuals living alone, there are certain limitations that need to be addressed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Internet Dependency:} The real-time health monitoring and emergency alert system require a stable internet connection, which may not always be available in remote areas.
    \item \textbf{Device Compatibility:} The effectiveness of health tracking depends on integration with wearable devices, which may not be universally available or compatible with all elderly users.
    \item \textbf{User Adoption and Digital Literacy:} Elderly individuals with limited technological experience may find it difficult to navigate the application without external assistance.
    \item \textbf{Privacy and Security Concerns:} Handling sensitive health data requires robust encryption and authentication mechanisms to ensure data security and compliance with healthcare regulations.
    \item \textbf{Healthcare Integration Challenges:} The effectiveness of the app depends on cooperation from healthcare providers, which may vary based on location and medical policies.
\end{itemize}
